# Ansible Role:  `promtail`

Ansible role to setup [promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/).

> Further development of this Ansible role has been moved to Collection [bodsch.grafana](https://github.com/bodsch/ansible-collection-grafana).
> **This repository will therefore no longer be actively maintained.**

If `latest` is set for `promtail_version`, the role tries to install the latest release version.  
**Please use this with caution, as incompatibilities between releases may occur!**

The binaries are installed below `/usr/local/bin/promtail/${promtail_version}` and later linked to `/usr/bin`. 
This should make it possible to downgrade relatively safely.

The downloaded archive is stored on the Ansible controller, unpacked and then the binaries are copied to the target system.
The cache directory can be defined via the environment variable `CUSTOM_LOCAL_TMP_DIRECTORY`. 
By default it is `${HOME}/.cache/ansible/promtail`.
If this type of installation is not desired, the download can take place directly on the target system. 
However, this must be explicitly activated by setting `promtail_direct_download` to `true`.


## Requirements & Dependencies

Ansible Collections

- [bodsch.core](https://github.com/bodsch/ansible-collection-core)
- [bodsch.scm](https://github.com/bodsch/ansible-collection-scm)

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install bodsch.core
ansible-galaxy collection install bodsch.scm
```
or
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install --requirements-file collections.yml
```


### Operating systems

Tested on

* Arch Linux
* Debian based
    - Debian 10 / 11 / 12
    - Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04

> **RedHat-based systems are no longer officially supported! May work, but does not have to.**

### `promtail_runtime`

Runtime configuration of promtail.

The command line parameters of the service are configured here.

Normally this should not be necessary, as all parameters can also be adjusted via the configuration file.

```yaml
promtail_runtime:
